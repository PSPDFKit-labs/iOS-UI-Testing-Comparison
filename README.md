## iOS UI Testing Comparison

Demo project to show how UI testing frameworks compare to each other.
Here we are comparing *EarlGrey*, *KIF* and *XCUI*.

### What you need to do

To run this project you have to copy `PSPDFKit.framework`, which [you can download here](https://pspdfkit.com/#trynow) in the root folder.
Run all tests by selecting `Test` (CMD+U) on the `UITestingComparison` scheme. This will run all the UI test from the 3 different frameworks.
